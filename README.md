## 🛠 **What I've Done in This Project**

## 🎓 **What I've Learned During This Project**  
- Although I implemented a **state machine pattern** for this game, it turned out to be unnecessary. A simpler approach could have been used to manage the phases of gameplay, saving both time and resources.  
- Overcomplicating things is often a **waste of time and resources**. Simpler solutions can be more efficient.
