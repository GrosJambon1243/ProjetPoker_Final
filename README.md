<h3>What I've done in this project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Implementing and using a state machine pattern to control the multiple phases of gameplay</li>
  <li>Verifying what poker hand is being play and if it's better then the opponent's</li>
 
  
</ol>

<h3>What I've learned during this project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Although I've implemented a state machine patern for this game, it was unnecessary. I could've used a simpler way to manage the phases of gameplay. I would've save time and ressources doing so.</li>
  <li>Overcomplicating things is often a waste of time and ressources.</li>
  <li></li>
